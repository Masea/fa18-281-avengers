### XP Core Value - Eliminating Waste

- The seven wastes of software development are: 
	- partially done work
	- extra features
	- relearning
	- handoffs
	- delays
	- task switching
	- defects.

#### Week 1
- Helped team in taking decision within the scope of projects and not going into the details of extra features at initial level.
- Focused on defining independent task with deadline to stay on track.
	
#### Week 2
- Helped the team to come up with a backend project architecture to develop GO with MONGO API so as to reduce others time in learning  details from scratch.
- This will inturn help the team to focus on the system implementation, rather than learning concepts from scratch. Also, helps the team helps everyone in integration as all APIs have same format.
